# MTE121

My solution sets for the MTE121 Course, covering C++ and RobotC.

All code herein is protected by copyright. Any use of any part of the code must be attributed to Joe Dolina. I don't want to get in trouble :)

Note that the code in One a Day problems may not actually compile. The questions just ask for the logic, but I'll be working on building them out as working code in the future.
